class TaskfarmExecutor(object):
    """A generic parallel executor (taskfarm) based on MPI.
    This executor can be used to run generic jobs on multiple
    processes based on a master/worker pattern with MPI being used for
    communication between the master and the workers.
    Examples
    --------
    A basic example of how to use the `TaskfarmExecutor` to run
    `gprMax` models in parallel is given below.
    >>> from mpi4py import MPI
    >>> from gprMax.taskfarm import TaskfarmExecutor
    >>> from gprMax.model import run_model
    >>> # choose an MPI.Intracomm for communication (MPI.COMM_WORLD by default)
    >>> comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    >>> # choose a target function
    >>> func = run_model
    >>> # define job parameters
    >>> inputfile = 'some_input_file.in'
    >>> n_traces = 10
    >>> jobs = []
    >>> # create jobs
    >>> for i in range(n_traces):
    >>>    jobs.append({
    >>>        'inputfile': inputfile,
    >>>        'currentmodelrun': i + 1,
    >>>        'modelend': n_traces,
    >>>        'numbermodelruns': n_traces
    >>>    })
    >>> gpr = TaskfarmExecutor(func, comm=comm)
    >>> # send the workers to their work loop
    >>> gpr.start()
    >>> if gpr.is_master():
    >>>    results = gpr.submit(jobs)
    >>>    print('Results:', results)
    >>> # make the workers exit their work loop
    >>> # and join the main loop again
    >>> gpr.join()
    A slightly more concise way is to use the context manager
    interface of `TaskfarmExecutor` that automatically takes care
    of calling `start()` and `join()` at the beginning and end
    of the execution, respectively.
    >>> with TaskfarmExecutor(func, comm=comm) as executor:
    >>>    # executor will be None on all ranks except for the master
    >>>    if executor is not None:
    >>>        results = executor.submit(jobs)
    >>>        print('Results:', results)
    Limitations
    -----------
    Because some popular MPI implementations (especially on HPC machines) do not
    support concurrent MPI calls from multiple threads yet, the `TaskfarmExecutor` does
    not use a separate thread in the master to do the communication between the
    master and the workers. Hence, the lowest thread level of MPI_THREAD_SINGLE
    (no multi-threading) is enough.
    However, this imposes some slight limitations on the usage since it is not
    possible to interact with the workers during a call to `submit()` until
    `submit()` returns.
    In particular, it is not possible to handle exceptions that occur on workers
    in the main loop. Instead all exceptions that occur on workers are caught and
    logged and the worker returns None instead of the actual result of the worker
    function. A second limitation is that it is not possible to terminate workers.
    If you need an MPI executor that supports custom exception handling, you should
    use a multi-threading implementation such as the `MPICommExecutor` in
    `mpi4py.futures`. Below is a brief example of how to use it with the example
    given above.
    >>> from mpi4py.futures import MPICommExecutor
    >>> from concurrent.futures import as_completed
    >>> # define comm, func, and jobs like above
    >>> with MPICommExecutor(comm, root=0) as executor:
    >>>     if executor is not None:
    >>>         futures = [executor.submit(func, **job) for job in jobs]
    >>>         for future in as_completed(futures):
    >>>             try:
    >>>                 print(future.result())
    >>>             except Exception as e:
    >>>                 # custom exception handling for exceptions
    >>>                 # raised in the worker
    >>>                 print(e)
    >>>                 comm.Abort()
